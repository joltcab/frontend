## Fix Country Creation Not Working

This PR fixes the issue where creating countries was not working because the API was not accessible.

### Problem:
- Countries API was nested inside emergentIA object
- Frontend was trying to access joltcab.countries but it didn't exist at that level
- No POST requests were being sent to the backend

### Solution:
- Moved countries to class property level (same as emergentIA)
- Changed from this.countries to countries (class property)
- Now accessible as joltcab.countries
- Matches the emergentIA pattern

### Changes:
- Properly closed emergentIA object
- Added countries as separate class property
- Fixed indentation and closing braces

### Result:
- Build successful
- joltcab.countries.create() now accessible
- Country creation should work

### Testing:
After deployment, test by:
1. Go to AdminPanel Countries
2. Click Add New Country
3. Fill form and click Create Country
4. Should see POST request to /api/v1/countries in Network tab
5. Should see success toast and country in list
